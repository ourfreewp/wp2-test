# Future Work

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the WP2-Test framework, organized into three distinct phases focused on developer experience, advanced testing capabilities, and community growth.

---

## **Phase 6: Developer Experience (DX) Enhancements**

**Objective:** To streamline and simplify the testing workflow, reducing friction and accelerating development cycles.

* **Interactive Test Scaffolding**
  * **Purpose:** To eliminate the manual effort of creating test files through an intelligent, automated scaffolding tool.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * A new WP-CLI command, `wp test scaffold <class_name>`, will be introduced.
    * The command will use static analysis to inspect the target class's dependencies.
      * If usage of `$wpdb` or `wp_remote_post` is detected, it will recommend an Integration Test (`Integration\Scenario`).
      * Otherwise, it will default to a Unit Test (`Unit\Scenario`).
    * The generated test file will be pre-populated with the correct namespace, the appropriate base class, and `set_up()` / `tear_down()` methods.
    * **Advanced Mocking:** For unit tests, the scaffolder will identify WordPress functions (e.g., `get_option`, `add_action`) used in the target class and pre-populate the test with corresponding `expectations()` mocks.

* **Advanced IDE Integration**
  * **Purpose:** To provide developers with rich autocompletion, type-hinting, and static analysis directly within VS Code.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * A command will be created to generate configuration and stub files compatible with popular VS Code extensions like Intelephense.
    * This enables robust static analysis within the editor, allowing developers to catch errors before running tests.

* **Visual Test Runner (Admin UI)**
  * **Purpose:** To lower the barrier to entry for developers who are less comfortable with the command line.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * A new WordPress admin screen will provide a graphical interface for running tests.
    * Developers can select individual test files or entire suites to run with a button click.
    * Results will be displayed in a clean, color-coded interface within the WordPress dashboard, showing passing tests, failures, and errors.

## **Phase 7: Performance & Security Testing Integration**

**Objective:** To shift performance and security testing "left" by integrating these critical checks directly into the core development workflow.

* **E2E Performance Monitoring**
  * **Purpose:** To automatically capture frontend performance metrics as part of the end-to-end testing process.

* **Automated Security Auditing**
  * **Purpose:** To proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities before they reach production.

---

## **Phase 8: Ecosystem & Open Source Vision**

**Objective:** To release WP2-Test publicly, foster a thriving community, and establish the framework as a leading testing solution for WordPress.

* **Public Release & Documentation**
  * **Purpose:** To package the framework for public consumption and provide world-class documentation.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * The framework will be published as a public package on Packagist, making it installable via Composer.
    * A dedicated documentation website will be launched, featuring:
      * **Quick Start Guide:** A step-by-step tutorial for getting started.
      * **API Reference:** Detailed documentation for every class and method.
      * **Practical Recipes:** Real-world examples for common scenarios (e.g., testing custom REST endpoints, testing data migrations).

* **Community Building & Evangelism**
  * **Purpose:** To build a thriving community of users and contributors.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * **Content Marketing:** Publish articles on prominent WordPress development blogs (e.g., WPTavern, Smashing Magazine, CSS-Tricks).
    * **Video Tutorials:** Create a YouTube series covering topics from basic setup to advanced patterns.
    * **Community Hub:** Establish an official Discord server for real-time support and community engagement.
    * **Conference Presence:** Present talks and workshops at major WordPress events like WordCamp US and WordCamp Europe.

* **Expanding the E2E Adapter Ecosystem**
  * **Purpose:** To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the E2E architecture by supporting more services.
  * **Implementation Details:**
    * Develop and release official E2E adapters for:
      * **Playwright:** For code-based browser automation.
      * **Cypress:** A popular choice in the JavaScript ecosystem.
      * **BrowserStack / Sauce Labs:** For automated cross-browser and cross-device testing.
