# Future Work

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the WP2-Test framework,Here is your refactored project roadmap, with the features reorganized into unordered initiatives and projects, as you requested. This new structure provides a clear, flexible overview of your goals without the constraints of a phased approach.

## Initiatives & Projects

### Developer Experience (DX) Enhancements

This initiative is focused on streamlining and simplifying the testing workflow to accelerate development cycles.

* **Interactive Test Scaffolding:** An intelligent WP-CLI command (`wp test scaffold <class_name>`) that automatically generates test files. It will use static analysis to recommend the correct test type, pre-populate the file with boilerplate code, and include **Advanced Mocking** by identifying and mocking WordPress functions.
* **Advanced IDE Integration:** A command to generate configuration and stub files for popular extensions like Intelephense, enabling rich autocompletion and static analysis within VS Code.
* **Visual Test Runner (Admin UI):** A new WordPress admin screen that provides a graphical interface for running tests. Developers will be able to select tests and view color-coded results directly in the dashboard.

### Performance & Security Testing Integration

This initiative aims to integrate critical performance and security checks directly into the core development workflow.

* **E2E Performance Monitoring:** A feature that automatically captures frontend performance metrics as part of the end-to-end testing process.
* **Automated Security Auditing:** Aims to proactively identify potential security vulnerabilities before they reach production.

### Ecosystem & Open Source Vision

This initiative is designed to release WP2-Test publicly, foster a thriving community, and establish the framework as a leading testing solution for WordPress.

* **Public Release & Documentation:** The framework will be published as a public package on Packagist and will have a dedicated documentation website with guides, API references, and real-world examples.
* **Community Building & Evangelism:** A multi-pronged approach that includes content marketing, video tutorials, a community hub on Discord, and presentations at major WordPress events.
* **Expanding the E2E Adapter Ecosystem:** To demonstrate the architecture's flexibility, the project will develop and release official E2E adapters for services like Playwright, Cypress, and BrowserStack/Sauce Labs.

---

### Enterprise & CI/CD Integration

This initiative will bridge the gap between local development and professional deployment pipelines, making the framework a first-class citizen in enterprise environments.

* **Official CI/CD Configuration Recipes:** Provide turnkey configuration files (.yml) for popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and CircleCI, including best practices for caching dependencies and running tests in parallel.
* **Advanced Reporting & Dashboards:** Integrate with test case management tools like TestRail and Xray. The framework will generate detailed reports (e.g., HTML, JUnit, JSON) that include trend analysis, code coverage metrics, and performance benchmarks.
* **Dockerized Testing Environments:** Develop and publish official Docker images pre-configured with PHP, WordPress, and all necessary dependencies.
* **Slack & Teams Notifications:** A feature to send test run summaries and failure alerts directly to team collaboration platforms.

### AI-Powered Testing & Optimization

This initiative leverages artificial intelligence to make the testing process more intelligent, adaptive, and insightful.

* **AI-Powered Test Generation:** The test scaffolder will evolve into an advanced tool that uses a large language model (LLM) to analyze class logic and generate meaningful test cases, including edge cases.
* **Visual Regression "Diff" Advisor:** An AI-powered tool that analyzes screenshot differences when a visual regression test fails and attempts to correlate the visual change to a specific CSS rule or DOM element, pointing developers to the likely source.
* **Predictive Test Selection:** A machine learning feature for CI/CD environments that analyzes committed code and runs only the tests most likely to be affected by the changes, dramatically speeding up build times.
* **Automated Test Refactoring:** A new WP-CLI command (`wp test refactor`) that scans the test suite for common anti-patterns and suggests or automatically applies refactors.
